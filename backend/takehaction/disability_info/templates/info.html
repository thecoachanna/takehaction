        <p class="faq-content">Behavioral health issues make up a substantial percentage of 911 calls for which police
          have been the <a href="https://www.vera.org/behavioral-health-crisis-alternatives">default first
            responders</a>. One <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/community-responder-model/">recent
            analysis</a> of eight cities found that between 21 and 38 percent of 911 calls are related to mental health,
          substance use, homelessness, and other quality of life concerns.<br><br>

          This has had disastrous consequences. A third to half of all people killed by law enforcement officers are
          disabled individuals. (<a

          People under age 30 with disabilities are 44% more likely to be arrested, according to <a
            href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304095">2017 research from the American
            Journal of Public Health</a>. This statistic includes emotional, sensory, physical, and cognitive
          disabilities that are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

          determine whether a person has a covered disability as follows:<br><br></p>

        <ol>
          <li>A law enforcement officer shall make a diligent effort to determine whether any disabled person the
            officer finds is an epileptic or a diabetic, or suffers from some other type of illness that would cause the
            condition. Whenever feasible, this effort must be made before the person is charged with a crime or taken to
            a place of detention.</li><br>
          <li>In seeking to determine whether a disabled person suffers from an illness, a law enforcement officer shall
            make a reasonable search for an identifying device and an identification card of the type described in
            subsection 2 of section 23-28-02 and examine them for emergency information.</li><br>
          <li>A law enforcement officer who finds a disabled person without an identifying device or identification card
            is not relieved of the officer's duty to that person to make a diligent effort to ascertain the existence of
            any illness causing the disabled condition.</li>

        </summary>
        <p class="faq-content">Some behavior stemming from a disability may come across as suspicious, such as public
          disruption or disorientation. Because of the doctrine of qualified immunity, police generally cannot be held
          liable in court for doing their job.<br><br>

          However, if the police are arresting, or have arrested, an individual protected under the ADA, the rules
          change. If police officers do anything that seems unreasonable to a person with a disability, there is a good
          chance the case will go to trial despite qualified immunity.<br><br>

          Police in Colorado, Louisiana, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and Oklahoma are required to search
          for an identifying card that might determine whether a person has a covered disability.
